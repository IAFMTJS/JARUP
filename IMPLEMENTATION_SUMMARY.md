# JARUP Implementation Summary

## Completed Improvements ✅

### 1. Home Page Statistics (Fixed)
- **Issue**: Hardcoded statistics that didn't reflect actual data
- **Solution**: 
  - Imported all character and vocabulary data
  - Calculate real-time totals from actual data
  - Language-specific character counts (Japanese: 125 chars, Russian: 33 chars)
  - Language-specific vocabulary counts (Japanese: 268 words, Russian: 203 words)
  - Dynamic lesson count (18 total lessons)
- **Files Modified**: `app/page.tsx`

### 2. Language Preference Persistence
- **Issue**: Language selection didn't persist across sessions
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `localStorage` persistence for language preference
  - Automatically loads last selected language on page visit
- **Files Modified**: `app/page.tsx`

### 3. Spaced Repetition System (Vocabulary)
- **Issue**: No intelligent review scheduling for vocabulary
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented full SM-2 algorithm-based spaced repetition
  - Added mastery tracking (new → learning → mastered)
  - Created review scheduling based on performance
  - Added multiple review modes:
    - Due: Shows words that need review
    - New: Only new words
    - Learning: Words being learned
    - Mastered: Fully mastered words
    - All: All words
  - Progress visualization with mastery percentage
- **Files Created**: `lib/spaced-repetition.ts`
- **Files Modified**: `app/vocabulary/page.tsx`

### 4. 3D Card Flip Animation
- **Issue**: Basic card flip interaction
- **Solution**: 
  - Added smooth 3D perspective-based card flip
  - Enhanced visual feedback with CSS transitions
  - Added confetti animation support
- **Files Modified**: `app/globals.css`, `app/vocabulary/page.tsx`

### 5. Complete Exercise Type Implementation
- **Issue**: Only basic typing exercises were implemented
- **Solution**: 
  - Implemented all exercise types:
    - **Multiple Choice**: Interactive button-based selection
    - **Matching**: Drag-and-drop style matching with dropdowns
    - **Typing**: Text input with validation
    - **Fill-in-the-blank**: Text input with context
    - **Audio**: Audio playback with transcription input
  - Added proper answer validation for each type
  - Enhanced visual feedback with icons (CheckCircle/XCircle)
  - Reset state between exercises properly
  - Support for array-based correct answers
- **Files Modified**: `app/lessons/[id]/page.tsx`

### 6. Audio Pronunciation Support
- **Issue**: No audio in lesson exercises
- **Solution**:
  - Integrated `speak()` function from `lib/speech.ts`
  - Added Volume2 icon for audio playback
  - Audio support for audio-type exercises
- **Files Modified**: `app/lessons/[id]/page.tsx`
